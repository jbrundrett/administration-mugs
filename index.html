        <h2>Jerry Kang</h2>
        <p>Jerry Kang is the vice chancellor for Inclusion, Diversity and Equity, a position that was created last year, after a report conducted by a former California Supreme Court Justice found UCLA insufficiently addressed claims of racial discrimination. </p>
        <p>Kang’s office aims to create the procedures and capacity to conduct independent investigations of alleged discrimination, harassment and sexual violence. Before he was selected for the position, Kang said he plans to use empirical evidence to cite cases of discrimination by comparing salaries, employee skill level and race, for example.</p>
        <p>Professor Kang graduated magna cum laude from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, where he was a supervising editor of the Harvard Law Review. Before coming to UCLA in 1995, Kang was a clerk for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Kang is also an Asian American studies and law professor at UCLA. </p>
