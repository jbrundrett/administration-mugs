    <h1 id="main-title">Profiles of UCLA's Administration</h1>
    <p>Vice chancellors and the chancellor are the highest levels of UCLA’s administrative structure. Chancellor Gene Block is at the top of the hierarchy and is in charge of fulfilling the university’s mission. Below Block is Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Scott Waugh who directly oversees the nine vice chancellors. Each of the nine vice chancellor positions supervise a specific aspect of campus, with some doing behind-the-scenes work, such as legal affairs, and others doing work that engages students directly, such as in student affairs.</p>
